				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>A new law has come into force in Hungary which threatens to push thousands of Ukrainian refugees onto the streets or back to Ukraine. More than 30,000 Ukrainians are stuck in Hungary and need our help.</p>
				<p>For many, the change will result in job losses and impact school enrolment, jeopardizing the positive integration achievements obtained so far.</p>
				<p>The solution is to relocate them to Canada through the Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET) program. This project aims to provide support to Ukrainians currently stranded in Hungary and assist them in their journey to Canada through the CUAET program. We are dedicated to helping those in need during these challenging times.</p>
